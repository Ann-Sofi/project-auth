# Project Auth by Julia & Ann-Sofi

This is a project made with pair programming during the Technigo bootcamp. The assignment was to build an API with authentication to implement a registration flow, and a frontend with forms to register, sign in, and view some content once you're logged in.

## The project

# Backend
We started with the backend and it's created using express, mongoose and MongoDB.
The backend has three endpoints.
- A POST to create a new user.
- A POST for an existing user to login.
- A GET that is only avaliable for an authenticated user with a valid accesstoken.


# Frontend
The frontend is created using React redux, router and styled components. We have a form for Sign In, another for Sign Up and a secret page that the user get access to when they sucessfully sign in or sign up.
